								<p>Hi! I am 20 years old, working a casual job at McDonalds while I study and living in my family home in Geelong, Victoria. I was born, have lived, and studied here in Geelong for my whole life. In my younger years I ‘studied’, if you can even call primary school study, at Leopold Primary School, and later found myself studying at Geelong High School. As much as I have an interest in IT, I also love cars and photography and combining the two. I find just being alone taking photos to be very relaxing and calming, even if my photos turn out horrible.

				<!-- Interest in IT -->
							<article id="ITInterest">
								<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
								
							  <p>I have always had a keen interest in IT, which I can mostly attribute to watching my dad design websites in the early 2000s.
								At school I was always in and out of IT, partly because we barely had enough students interested in the subject and partly because the teachers that we had to teach the subject had very surface level understandings of IT. This made things difficult for me to properly engage with the subject and I eventually found myself losing interest in it. 
								Fast forward to year 12 and I wound up in a programming class. This started off well actually, but it went downhill quickly and anyone who has studied at a public school will know, distractions are a plenty and I found myself again losing interest.
								My interest was rekindled however when I started tinkering with things on my computer, pulling apart games to see how they work and how I could modify them to better suit my needs and wants. I just recently built myself a new PC which got me all excited about new hardware again. I guess a bit of introspection into what I really want out of life kept bringing me back to IT.</p>
								<p>								 
								So why RMIT? I am not going to lie; I had no idea the sheer volume of courses and universities on offer until my girlfriend and I went through it together. She was the one who put me onto this course through open universities and RMIT. There was a lot of deliberation into on campus study vs online study, but with the current global situation I figured why not go 100% online? If there was any course to do completely online, it is this one. </p>
								<p>
								I expect to learn a lot about myself and the subject of IT during my studies. I have never really looked at myself and my study habits. I expect it to be hard, and it is going to take a lot of intrinsic motivation. I want to and expect to learn how to properly study. How to knuckle down and get the best out of myself. I expect to learn how to form, develop and present an idea, to not only assessors but possible future employers as well. I expect to learn how to get the most of my workflow, i.e. making my workflow as efficient and effective as possible. Ultimately I expect to learn the skills required to put me on the path to my

								<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
								<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50518517?type=promoted#searchRequestToken=6477f740-6bed-4d8d-9cc9-a1a6dd81bd56"><span class="image main"><img src="images/pic08.png" alt="" /></span></a>
								<h3 class="major">Job Overview</h3>
								<p>The position I found is for a <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50518517?type=promoted#searchRequestToken=6477f740-6bed-4d8d-9cc9-a1a6dd81bd56">Software Engineering role at the Australian Secret Intelligence Service</a>, this role is available in many levels.  The position requires a software engineer that is able to solve a broad range of foreign intelligence collection problems by being able to creatively and innovatively develop a solution technically. Some other tasks might include, research, design, prototyping and development of solutions for the problems faced. The job is flexible and seems to encompass a broad range of tasks, which interests me as I would love to have a job that has a lot of different aspects to it and seems versatile. There is also just a thrill in working in secret intelligence!</p>
								<h3 class="major">Required Skills</h3>
								<p>Whilst this job seems to be enthusiastic about teaching an applicant once they are part of the team, the requirements are very heavily weighted on past experience. Applicants should have proven experience in a versatile, SCRUM team. Candidates must also have some relevant experience in one or more of the following programming languages: Java, C, C++, C#, .NET and/or Kotlin. Whilst it is not a requirement, it is also favourable to have experience in any of the following: Linux administration, experience developing web, desktop and mobile applications and/or cloud technologies. Other than experience, a tertiary education in a IT/ software engineering centric field is highly regarded but not required.</p>
								<h3 class="major">My existing skills and qualifications.</h3>
								<p>Right now, I feel as though I am in more of a learning and knowledge gaining stage and I do not have many of the desirable traits for this job yet. My knowledge and expertise in software engineering very limited. However, by continuing my studies in IT, and Programming (COSC2452), I am hoping to learn and progress toward meeting those requisites. I understand experience is very import however so a junior job in software engineering may be required before looking into a job as high up as this. I regard myself as being quite resilient, and if there is a problem that needs solving I will work as hard as necessary to solve it. I have found this to be a handy skill to have when it comes to troubleshooting, and a skill that would be very valuable in the field of IT and software development. In terms of qualifications? I can make you a mean big mac, but that is where it ends. Being fresh out of high school I do not have any qualifications, unless you count VCE, so while I am a long way from my ‘dream job’, it is definitely something I am willing to work towards.</p>
								<h3 class="major">Plan for success</h3>
								<p>My plan right now to obtain the skills and qualifications required is to work hard and finish this course and eventually my degree to the highest standard I can. All the while learning and improving key skills in the areas most valuable, such as troubleshooting, working as a team and developing an idea and sticking with it until the end. I plan to familiarise myself with the software and programs necessary to attain my goal of my ideal job.

								<h2 class="major">Project Idea</h2>
								<h3 class="major">Overview</h3>
								<p>My project will be an automated blinds control system. I aim to design, develop and produce a ‘do it yourself kit’ alternative to the big name brand Electronic blind controllers, which, at $220 per controller certainly aren’t a cost-effective solution. I will make use of a Raspberry Pi, as they can be purchased relatively cheaply, and a stepper motor to drive the blinds. The blinds will be programmable to certain parameters, e.g. Time, sunrise/sunset, user defined weather conditions, or via a hardware controller. Time permitting a mobile companion app would make a lot of sense, however it will not be a design requirement. 
								<h3 class="major">Motivation</h3>
								<p>My motivations lie within both laziness in that I am too lazy to get up and put my blinds up, as well making an action as simple as opening the blinds, accessible to those who may not be able to do it themselves. Another motivating factor is cost. Off the shelf automated blind solutions costing more than $200 puts the barrier of entry quite high, and when houses have numerous windows with blinds that cost adds up. Using a Raspberry Pi and stepper motors significantly lowers that barrier and opens up house automation to be more accessible.
								<h3 class="major">Description</h3>
								<p>My solution will make use of a Raspberry Pi and, via OpenWeatherMaps API, will control your blinds based on weather conditions. The solution will incorporate hardware controls, i.e. buttons, dials, sliders, but also controllable via a graphical user interface on a display. The Raspberry Pi will make use of the aforementioned API to pull accurate, location-based weather data. Making use of a small OLED or similar low power usage display, the solution will display current weather information, next scheduled operation and blind status. The display will also allow the solution to run as a standalone unit without the need for companion app, although this would be a nice feature to have a possibly develop down the line. The display will show the current status, but also flick to quick settings when pressing a hardware button. The display will allow the user to configure the conditions under which the blinds are operated. These will include but are not limited to; sunset/sunrise, time triggers, weather conditions such as temperature, cloud cover and precipitation. These weather events will be based on the location of the device, which can be set manually via postcode or set to configure automatically over IP.
								<h3 class="major">Tools Used</h3>
								<p>Some of the tools required will be a Raspberry Pi, I have gone with a 4gb ‘4’ model, however this is just to give me flexibility in terms of what I can use it for. The lower specification models will work just fine as the program will not be very taxing on the hardware. A stepper motor and driver board will also be necessary to drive the blinds. The project will make use of OpenWeatherMaps, an openly available weather API used to pull weather information. A small display will also be used to display current weather information, blind status, and the next blind operation. The whole operation will run on Linux, a free open source operating system.
								<h3 class ="major">Skills Required</h3>
								<p>The skills required to develop this project will be varied. I will need to learn how to program for the Raspberry Pi system. I will also need hardware skills in putting the solution together. I foresee some 3d printing to be required, however I am already somewhat familiar with 3d modelling and printing. The hardware and software is easily acquired; stepper motors and their driver boards are easily purchased from electronics websites, and Raspberry Pis can be purchased directly from the <a href ="https://raspberry.piaustralia.com.au/"target="_blank">Raspberry Pi website.</a> In terms of learning the skills required for the project, there are many detailed tutorials on the <a href ="https://raspberry.piaustralia.com.au/"target="_blank">Raspberry Pi website.</a>
								
								
								<h3 class ="major">Outcome</h3>
								<p>If the project is successful, I will have created a fully automated blinds control system. The original problem of having to manually operate blinds will be replaced with the automated system and I will no longer have to get up out of my seat to open and close my blinds. This will help keep my productivity up, by reducing the distraction that glaring sun and having to close the blinds manually is.
